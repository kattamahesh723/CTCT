# CTCT

In this project I am trying to solve all the CTCT (Cracking the coding interview) book questions. Even though all kinds of solutions are presented in the books, there are still some areas where we can improve ourselves by discussing with others, either it can be "coding skills" or "Better algorithm". Any help regarding modification of any code part or any suggestions where I can improve are most welcome.
